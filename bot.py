# File handler alongside the existing stdout one — recommended in the
# post-P6 architecture review (§6.3) since the bot currently runs as a
# local `python bot.py` process, not under systemd/journald, meaning
# anything only logged to stdout is lost the moment the terminal
# session ends or scrolls past. RotatingFileHandler caps disk usage
# (5MB x 3 backups = 15MB max) so this can't grow unbounded. Once this
# actually moves under systemd for real hosting, journald makes this
# redundant (not harmful, just unnecessary) — safe to leave either way.
