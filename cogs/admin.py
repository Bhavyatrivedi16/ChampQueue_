    Format is position-first (2026-08-20 revision): admin types the
    in-game rank badge directly instead of a derived/sorted score.
    Matches the real OCR pipeline's own contract exactly — the vision
    prompt (services/vision_extraction.py) reads position from the
    game-provided rank badge and explicitly says "never derive this
    from score/kills". The old version sorted player-typed `score`
    values to GUESS position, which both diverged from how the real
    pipeline works and turned out to be fragile (a field-count mismatch
    silently shifted every column — see the 2026-08-19 fix history in
    this file's git log). `score` itself is dropped from admin input
    entirely and stored as 0 in match_player_stats: confirmed via
    repo-wide grep that nothing reads it back once position is
    explicit (utils/embeds.py's result_card() also sorts by score, but
    has zero live callers — verified separately, not a live path).

    Placeholder carries format + one example line (2026-08-19 fix,
    format updated 2026-08-20) — the fuller _STAT_HELP text lives in
