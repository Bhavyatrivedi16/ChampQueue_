# Fixed-width columns for the code-block leaderboard layout (2026-09).

# Discord's mobile client, so lines of wildly different IGN length
# (e.g. "SumitCantSnipe" vs "-EaSy-") render with a visibly zigzagging
# "—" separator — cosmetic, but reported as looking rough on mobile.
# A ```code block``` is the only Discord-side way to force real column
# alignment; the cost is losing **bold**/color styling, which only
# applies inside code blocks as literal characters, not formatting.
# _IGN_COL_WIDTH chosen from real leaderboard data: "SumitCantSnipe" is
# 14 chars, the longest IGN seen so far; 16 gives a little headroom
# without ballooning line width on mobile. Longer real names get
# truncated with a trailing "…" rather than wrapping (wrapping inside a
# code block breaks alignment on the wrapped continuation line, which
