    found live: users frequently forgot the CQ- prefix, used lowercase,
    or dropped the hyphen ("1324", "cq1324", "cq-1324"), got an exact-
    match failure with no clear next step, and had to re-attempt the
    whole upload. Rather than pre-filling a hint (Discord slash-command
    string options don't support a default value), this normalizes on
    the receiving end so ANY reasonable variant of the code works on the
    first try, regardless of entry point (/match-submit, /match-correction
    both funnel through this — the modal-based entry point mentioned in
    an earlier version of this docstring was removed 2026-08-15, see
    the REMOVED note near match-submit-post further down this file). Strips everything except letters/digits, then
    re-assembles as CQ-<digits> — so "cq1324", "1324", " CQ-1324 ",
    "Cq1324" all normalize to "CQ-1324". If the result doesn't look like
    a valid code (no digits at all), returns the cleaned-but-unprefixed

    # early on the assumption a button would be easier for players than
    # a slash command; in practice it added a needless extra step (modal

    # /match-submit anyway — see start_submission's old docstring) with

    # start_submission was only called by that modal; match_submit
    # itself never touched any of this. The bot.add_view(...) call

    # setup() at the bottom of this file — leaving that in place after
    # removing the class would have crashed the bot on next restart

    # earlier this session.

    # reading it off the channel name, so a typo failed with a generic
    # "Match not found" instead of ever reaching the log-post step.

    # confirmed on CQ-2063: /rc posted the match-log entry correctly.

        1. Exact match (case-insensitive) on the raw OCR string — the
           overwhelming common case, zero risk.
        2. Fuzzy match on the raw string (see _fuzzy_lookup) — catches

        3. Strip a "(...)" suffix, if present, and retry as an EXACT match
           on the remainder. CQ Mobile appends a parenthetical after some
           players' names on the scoreboard — a short/lowercase echo of
           their own IGN shown when the full name gets truncated (e.g.
           "RVL.Eiji(eiji)", "CÖNÑÖR(Con...)"). This is UI chrome, not part
           of the IGN, and OCR reads it verbatim per its prompt ("string,
           exactly as shown"). Never reads what was inside the parens —
           only ever discards it and matches on the part before "(".
        4. Strip the same "(...)" suffix and retry with a full fuzzy pass
           (_fuzzy_lookup again) on the remainder — catches the combined
           case where a player's name has BOTH the parenthetical AND an
           ordinary OCR character slip in the base name (e.g. OCR misreads
           "RVL.Eiji(eiji)" as "RVL.Eijl(eiji)"), which step 3's exact-only
           check can't catch on its own. Same collision-safety tiebreak as
           step 2, just run a second time on the stripped string.

        Steps 3 and 4 are a genuine last resort — they only run once
        BOTH step 1 and step 2 already missed against the raw string —
        so nothing about today's exact/fuzzy behavior changes for the
        overwhelming majority of IGNs that don't contain "(" at all.

        # the screen-team counter only worked when the two letters

        # short a player rendered as "B" that round), this check
