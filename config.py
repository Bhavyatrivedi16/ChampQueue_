    QWEN_API_KEY               required if VISION_PROVIDER=qwen
    ADMIN_ROLE_IDS             Comma-separated Discord role IDs allowed to approve players,

                               upload scoreboards on a host's behalf. Multiple roles supported
                               so HOD + admin team all carry identical full admin power — see

# Server moved to one unified show with four ticket-counter queues, kept
# separate for matchmaking throughput / ping reasons only. Everything
# downstream of "a match happened" collapses into ONE pool: one upload
# channel, one approval channel, one match-log (already was), one
# leaderboard. QUEUE_KEYS is the source of truth for which 4 queues
# exist — used for queue-post buttons, per-queue locks, and validating
# /queue-post's region argument. This is DELIBERATELY separate from
# players.region (see REGIONS below) — queue_key is "which physical
# queue is this match/entry in", region is "informational label the
# player picked at registration", and the whole point of this change is
# that the two no longer have to match.

# never read by queue/match/channel logic. Old East/West values are left

# so nothing chokes on historical data; only NEW registrations should use
# the 4 new values going forward.

# off the match's own `region` column. That split existed only because
# East/West were role-gated into separate channel visibility; the new
# unified-region design explicitly wants ONE upload channel and ONE
# approval channel for all 4 queues, so the per-region dict is gone.
# If RESULT_UPLOAD_CHANNEL_ID / RESULT_APPROVAL_CHANNEL_ID aren't set,

# more than once. registration.py deliberately dropped self-service
# /update-ign (see its own comment) in favor of admin-only correction here.
