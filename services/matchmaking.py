"""
Matchmaking service: turns 10 queued players into two balanced 5-player
teams, and decides whether we're still in the "bootstrap" (random) phase
or the analysis-driven phase.

Bootstrap cutover rule (see config.BOOTSTRAP_MATCH_THRESHOLD /
BOOTSTRAP_MIN_ELIGIBLE_POOL): calendar time is not a reliable proxy for
"enough data exists", so we gate on match counts instead of days.
A given match runs in analysis mode only if ALL 10 players in that
queue pop have already reached the match threshold; otherwise it's a
bootstrap (random) match, and it still counts toward every player's
threshold progress.

Analysis-mode split (2026-08): exhaustive evaluation of all C(10,5)=252
possible 5-player splits, scored on a composite metric (MMR-dominant).
Wired up 2026-08 — previously balance_teams() computed a snake-draft
split every match but cogs/queue.py discarded the result and used
even-odd join-order instead (see DECISIONS.md "Team split: join-order
vs MMR-balanced" — flagged there as "a real gap, not intentional").
Historical replay against 145 real match pops confirmed even-odd
produced a mean team-MMR gap of ~116-262 depending on measurement
method (see session notes); the true optimal split for those same
pops averaged a 3-10 point gap. Exhaustive search over 252 splits is
sub-millisecond (benchmarked ~0.39ms), completely negligible against
the >1s of Discord API calls (channel/VC creation) that follow team
formation in cogs/queue.py's _start_match_flow.

Randomization (2026-08): rather than always picking the single
mathematically-best split, we collect every split within
config.TEAM_SPLIT_EPSILON composite-points of the true optimum and
pick uniformly at random among them. This exists because a fully
deterministic split means the same 10 players (a common occurrence in
a small community that queues together repeatedly) would get the
identical team lineup every time — swapping "random, sometimes
lopsided" for "predictable, always the same two crews" is its own
complaint waiting to happen. Every candidate in the pool is
near-optimal by construction, so this never trades away real balance
for variety. Epsilon=10 was chosen by replaying it against all 145
real historical match pops: every single pop produced at least 2
candidate splits (never a de-facto single option), median 8 candidates
per pop, and the randomly-sampled diff stayed at a 7-14 point median/
mean — negligible against this project's MMR scale (players observed
ranging roughly 0-990 composite).

Uncertainty discount (2026-08): a player who just crossed
BOOTSTRAP_MATCH_THRESHOLD has far less real signal behind their stats
than a 90+ match veteran, but _composite_score() alone can't tell the
difference — it takes every player's numbers at face value regardless
of sample size. Same problem every competitive matchmaker has to
solve (Rainbow Six Siege, OpenSkill, TrueSkill all track a skill
estimate AND a separate confidence/uncertainty value). Solved here via
_uncertainty_discount(): a per-player deduction from their composite
score, based purely on total_matches, that shrinks as they play more
— never based on whether their individual stats "look consistent",
since an earlier version of this (flagging players whose MMR and KD
disagreed with each other) ended up penalizing the server's most
active veteran hardest, precisely because a large sample size makes a
real skill gap between two metrics look bigger than a small sample's
noise does. That's backwards — more data should mean more trust.
Match-count-only avoids that trap by construction. Calibrated against
197 real historical match pops (base=50, half_life=20): smallest
average-balance cost of every combination tested (+0.53 pts over the
no-discount baseline of 6.87), while still giving a 10-match player a
~40 point discount and a 97-match veteran only ~21 — proportionate at
both ends, not a cliff and not a token gesture.

    left pointing at the old RO3 value.

    Analysis mode is TEMPORARILY DISABLED (falls back to the same random
    pick as bootstrap) — found live 2026-07-20, crashing every match once
    a roster crosses BOOTSTRAP_MATCH_THRESHOLD: this queried matches.map
    and matches.winner_team, both pre-RO3 columns that don't exist on the
    live schema anymore (maps live in matches.map_pool as an array now;
    there's no single-match winner_team since RO3 counts wins/losses at
    the round level — see recompute_player_career_stats in
    migration_006_p6_full.sql for the correct current pattern). This
    function was apparently never actually exercised until a real roster
    crossed the bootstrap threshold for the first time tonight.

    Real fix (not done here — this is a stop-the-bleeding fix, not a
    rebuild) needs rewriting the balance heuristic against
    match_round_results + matches.map_pool instead of the dead columns.
    Flagged as real follow-up work, not silently deferred — random
    selection is a safe, correct fallback in the meantime (bootstrap

    not the smarter balanced pick that was originally intended here.

    with pure random.sample() over only 5 maps (1-in-5 repeat chance
    every single match), but it read as broken/unfair to players.
    queue_key is optional and best-effort: if provided, the previous
    match's map in that queue is excluded from the sample pool before
    picking. If querying last-played fails for any reason, or queue_key
    isn't passed, falls straight back to the original unrestricted
    random.sample() — this is a UX nicety, never worth blocking or
    crashing a match over. Only meaningfully changes behavior when
