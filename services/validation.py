"""
Decides whether an extracted scoreboard can be auto-accepted or must be
routed to admin review. Two independent triggers, either one forces review:

  1. Statistical outlier: any player's extracted stat is more than
     config.STAT_OUTLIER_STD_DEVS away from THAT PLAYER'S OWN rolling
     history (not the lobby average — a player's personal baseline is a
     much stronger signal than comparing across different skill levels).
Either trigger sets match.status = 'awaiting_review' instead of being
eligible for host approval.
